# Discrete Variable Representation
Discrete Variable Representation (DVR) is computational approach for solving the time independent [Schr√∂dinger equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation#Time-independent_equation).<sup>[1]</sup>
The algorithm is applicable for studying the [wave functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function#Position-space_wave_functions) of a molecular system given its [potential energy surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_energy_surface). Please see dvr_derivation.pdf for mathematical motivation. The core of this repository includes an object oriented `Python` DVR algorithm in one dimension.
