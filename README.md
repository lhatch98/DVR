# Discrete Variable Representation
Discrete Variable Representation (DVR) is computational approach for solving the time independent Schrodinger equation.
This code is generalized to one dimension and applicable for studying the wave functions of molecular systems. Please see dvr_derivation.pdf for the mathematical motivation.
